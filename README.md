# prototype-django-angular
Timeless Film Reviews is a web application for sharing and viewing spoiler-free movie reviews. This project uses Django for the backend and Angular for the frontend, providing a modern, full-stack solution for users interested in movie discussions. For accademic purposes only.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (for Angular)
- Git

# How to run
1. Clone the Repository
- Open your terminal.
- Clone the repository with: git clone https://github.com/ThomasHeusdens/prototype-django-angular
- Navigate to the project directory: cd prototype_django_angular

2. Backend Setup - Django
- Create and activate a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
- Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

- Install required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Set up the database: python manage.py migrate

3. Frontend Setup - Angular
- Navigate to the frontend folder: cd frontend
- Install Angular dependencies: npm install

4. Running the Application
4.1 Starting the Django Server
- From the backend folder, start the Django development server: python manage.py runserver
The backend API should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

4.2 Starting the Angular Development Server
- Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and start the Angular development server: ng serve
The Angular app should now be running at http://localhost:4200.

5. Connecting Frontend and Backend
Ensure that the Angular app makes requests to the Django backend. You might need to configure the API endpoints in Angularâ€™s environment files (e.g., environment.ts in frontend/src/environments/).
- For example, set API_URL in environment.ts to:
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api'
};
